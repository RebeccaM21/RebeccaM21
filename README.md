During the Digital Futures bootcamp, I studied full-stack software engineering. The course focused on pair programming, solo challenges and team engineering projects. Below are the projects that demonstrate my technical skills:

<strong> Personal Assistant, MAMS Accounting </strong>
<br> July 2019 - January 2022

<strong> Teaching Assistant, AE Tuition </strong>
<br> October 2016 - June 2018

<h3 align="left">ðŸ§  Skills</h3>

<strong> Quick Learner </strong>
- Self-taught how to play the guitar and piano, and self-taught singer. 
- Self-taught HTML & CSS prior to the Digital Futures Academy

<strong> Creative Thinker </strong>
- As well as being self-taught in various musical instruments, I also write musical compositions and have performed in various public events. When writing compositions, I produce both the lyrics and the accompanying melodies which requires a lot of attention to detail.

<strong> Problem Solver </strong>
- During my time in the Digital Futures Academy, we had many opportunities for self-led projects (all of which are listed above). This helped me to develop my own individual problem-solving skills and how to approach debugging code. I also learnt how to effectively communicate when there are blockers in my progress, so that I can receive the relevant help and reduce further delays in  completing the project.

<strong> Pair programming </strong>
- The majority of the Digital Futures Academy involved pair programming, and the academy concluded with a four-week long Agile team engineering project. Pair programming helped me to improve my coding skills, as well as develop my communication skills when working in teams. 
- To facilitate pair programming, we used Miro and Trello to create collaborative boards and divide the relevant tasks amongst the team members. 
- During the four-week long Agile team engineering project, we help stand-ups, retrospectives and learned how to work with a project manager to produce a satisfactory end product.

<strong> Communication </strong>
- During my time as a personal assistant in MAMS Accounting, I liased with clients to resolve the concerns within their accounts via phone calls and physical meetings. This allowed me to engage with different types of people and develop my skills in patience and communication.
